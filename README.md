There are a total of three functions, the first is that the student camera can only be visible to the host and cohost.

The second is for chat question and answer. If a student asks a question, it will give a hint to the teacher. When other students reply, that question will be marked as answered. 
When the teacher confirms that the problem has been answered correctly, the problem will be marked as solved.

The third is real-time video playback, in which students can watch the recording of the current lecture directly before the class and jump back to live mode, just like youtube live.


Camera function (Teacher Interface)
The option added to the pull-up menu when the teacher opens the camera is "Show host and co-host can see", after which is selected, a prompt will appear in the upper left corner 
of the students’ camera screen, telling the teacher that the student's camera is only visible to the host and co-host.

Video Sharing Function
In this function, Youtube Live’s and Zoom’s layout are used to simulate the online lessons, you can jump to previous content by progress bar and back to Live mode by drag the 
progress bar to the far right or just click "Live" button.

Chat function (Student Interface)
The main function of the chat box on the student side is to ask and answer questions, and the questions answered by the students will be marked as replied. 
To increase the desire of students to take the initiative to ask questions, when the problem has been solved, the students who asked the question will be notified.

Chat function (Teacher Interface)
Different from the student side, when a teacher replies to a student's question, the question will be directly marked as resolved.
When the teacher finds that other students' responses to a question are correct, the teacher can mark the question as resolved.
